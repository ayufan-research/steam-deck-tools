## Anti-Cheat and Antivirus software

Since this project uses direct manipulation of kernel memory via `inpoutx64.dll`
it might trigger Antivirus and Anti-Cheat software.

If you use at least version `0.5.x` you can disable kernel drivers usage that should
avoid trippping Anti-Cheat detection. Set FAN to `Default` and disable `OSD Kernel Drivers`.
Of course you will miss some metrics due to that.
